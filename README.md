# LootAppraiser
LootAppraiser (LA) is an addon which determines an item's value when looted based upon a pricing source you select. It keeps track of all gold asset value of the items in total including a quality item filter. Perfect for farming and determining looted item value (LIV) or potential gold-per-hour.

The reason ProfitzTV (Ray) developed this addon was because while proving out some gold earnings via farming, he was using spreadsheets for post-run calculations on item values and pricing models. Now, he just runs this addon, selects the price source he wants and lets it calculate it for him!

Please understand, this addon does NOT determine liquid gold you are guaranteed to make but rather, potential ‘asset’ values of items looted where you will have to do the work and sell it on the Auction House, trade chat, etc.
